# Recursive Test Specification

Create a simple TypeScript utility function that adds two numbers.

## Requirements

- Function should be named `add`
- Should accept two number parameters
- Should return the sum
- Include JSDoc comments
- Include a simple test file

This file has recursive mode enabled with a max depth of 5, so the agent will continue to refine the code until no more changes are needed or 5 iterations are reached.
