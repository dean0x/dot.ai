## Branch Naming Convention

All branches should follow this format:

```

```

### Types
- `feature/` - New features
- `fix/` - Bug fixes
- `refactor/` - Code refactoring
- `docs/` - Documentation changes
- `chore/` - Maintenance tasks

### Examples
```
feature/15-parallel-generation
fix/23-state-corruption
refactor/2-architecture-principles
docs/8-api-documentation
chore/5-dependency-updates
```

## Linking Branches to Issues

1. **Create branch with issue number:**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b refactor/2-architecture-principles
   ```

2. **Push to remote:**
   ```bash
   git push -u origin refactor/2-architecture-principles
   ```

3. **Link to issue:**
   ```bash
   gh issue comment <issue-number> --body "Working on this in branch \`<branch-name>\`"
   ```

## Commit Message Format

```

## Engineering Principles

Before contributing, review:
- `/home/node/.claude/CLAUDE.md` - Global engineering principles
- `SPECIFICATION.md` - Technical specification
- Existing code reviews in `.docs/audits/` (if available locally)

Key principles:
- Use Result types, not exceptions
- Inject dependencies
- Write pure functions
- Immutable data structures
- Strict TypeScript
- Test behaviors, not implementation
