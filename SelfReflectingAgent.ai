# Self-Reflecting Agent Template

**Purpose**: Create a [DESCRIBE YOUR GOAL] with iterative self-improvement through reflection.

---

## Requirements

Define what you want to build:

- [ ] Requirement 1: [Describe feature/functionality]
- [ ] Requirement 2: [Describe feature/functionality]
- [ ] Requirement 3: [Describe feature/functionality]

---

## Quality Criteria

The agent will evaluate its work against these criteria:

### Correctness
- [ ] Logic is correct and handles edge cases
- [ ] No obvious bugs or errors
- [ ] Proper error handling

### Completeness
- [ ] All requirements are implemented
- [ ] No missing features or half-implementations
- [ ] Documentation is complete

### Code Quality
- [ ] Follows language best practices
- [ ] Clean, readable code structure
- [ ] Proper type safety (if applicable)
- [ ] No code smells or anti-patterns

### Testing
- [ ] Comprehensive test coverage
- [ ] Tests actually validate behavior
- [ ] Edge cases are tested

### Performance
- [ ] No obvious performance issues
- [ ] Efficient algorithms chosen
- [ ] No unnecessary computations

### Security
- [ ] No security vulnerabilities
- [ ] Input validation present
- [ ] Safe handling of sensitive data

## Reflection Log

**Instructions for Agent**: After each generation, analyze your work critically and update this section.

### Iteration 1
*Agent will add findings here*

---

## Next Iteration

**Instructions for Agent**: If quality criteria are not met, specify what needs improvement here. If criteria ARE met, leave this section unchanged.

*Agent will add improvement tasks here if needed*

---

## Convergence Criteria

The agent should stop iterating when:
- All Quality Criteria checkboxes can be checked âœ“
- No critical or high-priority issues in Reflection Log
- "Next Iteration" section is empty or only has nice-to-have improvements

---

## Notes

- The agent will update this file after each iteration
- Iterations continue until quality criteria are met or max_recursion_depth reached
- Review the Reflection Log to see the agent's self-assessment
